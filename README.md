# peacock

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of peacock is to provide miscellaneous (for now) R scripts for
project initialization and workflows.

## Installation

You can install the development version of peacock from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("uab-cgds-worthey/Peacock")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(peacock)
## Initialize shiny project structure
proj_shiny_init()
#> You current working directory is:
#> /Users/samuelbharti/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UAB-TheUniversityofAlabamaatBirmingham/Work/packages/peacockDo you wish to create a project template here? (y/yes to confirm): 
#> Project initialization canceled.
```
